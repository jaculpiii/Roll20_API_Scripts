Things to add/fix  
  
  
**Bugs:**  
* Figure out and fix what is causing occasional crashes when using !group-init (another API script) to add groups of monsters to initiative.  Still trying to learn enough to reproduce the issue on demand.  
  
  
  
**New Features:**  
* Add clickable on Turn Notification marker list to remove each marker.  Perhaps where the duration is currently displayed and bump duration to the left a little.  
* Alphabetize Favorites list from !tj -listfavs  
* Create Favs categories???  
  * create categories (hard coded?)
  * assign categories via changefav and addfav
  * list favorites categories (listfavcats?)
  * list favorites BY category (listfavbycat?)
* Link conditions to a parent condition on another token (specifically for things like "blessed" linked to "concentration" and the like)  
* Find a way to export favorites to expedite setup across lobbies (perhaps as a macro that VTTES can export?)

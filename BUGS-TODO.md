Things to add/fix  
  
  
**Bugs:**  
* Figure out and fix what is causing occasional crashes when using !group-init (another API script) to add groups of monsters to initiative.  Still trying to learn enough to reproduce the issue on demand.  
  
  
  
**New Features:**  
* Add clickable on Turn Notification marker list to remove each marker.  Perhaps where the duration is currently displayed and bump duration to the left a little.  
* Create Favs categories???  
  * create categories (hard coded?)
  * assign categories via changefav and addfav
  * list favorites categories (listfavcats?)
  * list favorites BY category (listfavbycat?)
* Link conditions to a parent condition on another token (specifically for things like "blessed" linked to "concentration" and the like)  
* Find a way to export favorites to expedite setup across lobbies (perhaps as a macro that VTTES can export?)  
* Find a way to change some of the configuration settings from within roll20, maybe make them part of the state data so after the script is initially installed they could be loaded with a macro

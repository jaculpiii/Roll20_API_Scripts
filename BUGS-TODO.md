Things to add/fix  
  
  
**Bugs:**  
  
  
  
**New Features:**  
* Add "Next Up" on the Turn Notification
* Find a way to change some of the configuration settings from within roll20, maybe make them part of the state data so after the script is initially installed they could be loaded with a macro  
* Create Favs categories???  
  * create categories (hard coded?)
  * assign categories via changefav and addfav
  * list favorites categories (listfavcats?)
  * list favorites BY category (listfavbycat?)
* Link conditions to a parent condition on another token (specifically for things like "blessed" linked to "concentration" and the like)  
* Add clickable on Turn Notification marker list to remove each marker.  Perhaps where the duration is currently displayed and bump duration to the left a little.  


**Feature Requests**
* Make EOT button hideable
* Allow the default initiative value (normally -100) configurable
